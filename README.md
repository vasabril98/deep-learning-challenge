# Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Predictor

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to develop a binary classifier using neural network models for the fictional nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup who wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With the dataset provided, a binary classifier was created that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The dataset received is a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

* What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
